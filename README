Spark Monitor App
=================

This app can be used to monitor published variables on a Spark core device and display an alert when the variable
is set to a given value.

TODO: Modify the app so that it discovers the exposed variable and functions on the device and allows the user to
trigger a function (or maybe set a variable?)

Use cases:

1. User logs in, auth token is stored, user is taken to device list
1. User selects a device from the list of available devices
2. User adds/edits/deletes an alert in a list
3. User selects a device action (function to run - we'll make it so you can' only read variables and that actions
need to be performed via functions)

Stack

presentation - jQuery Mobile
view model binding - Angular
data layer - Backbone / persistence.js / PouchDB (don't know which)
when.js

I need offline storage and syncing (essentially caching) so I don't need to keep going back to the server for, e.g.,
device details. Persistence.js is probably overkill for this app, but would be god to get some experience with it.
I'll try Backbone.localStorage for now, the persistence later.
